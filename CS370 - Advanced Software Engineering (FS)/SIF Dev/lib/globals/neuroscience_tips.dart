KEY #1

Your brain is an amazing organ. You have millions of neurons which store
information in many different ways. When you learn a language, there are
neurons that store verbal information. There are also neurons which store
auditory information. When you read, your neurons store the symbols which
make up the written language and your brain decodes the symbols. Today you
will start to store the information of this new language.

const String wiringTip = ''' WIRING

KEY #2

When our brain receives stimulation, it accesses the stored information, and
begins to create neuropaths which connect the different neurons. Today we are
going to interconnect these neurons.

With stimulation and practice the neuropaths will become stronger and stronger
and your ability to speak and understand Spanish will improve. ''';

const String sensoryTip = '''  SENSORY INTEGRATION

KEY #3

The learning process is reinforced through our senses. When the senses are
stimulated, more information is retained in our long term memory. BPL® uses
visual, tactile and auditory techniques which stimulate the senses to reinforce
language learning.''';

const String attentionTip = ''' ATTENTION

KEY #4

Our normal attention span is around 15 minutes. We focus for a short time and
then our minds begin to wander. This is a natural process, but when it happens
the student can get lost and will be unable to retain new information. With the
BPL® system, our teachers are trained to recognize this and bring the student’s
attention back to the classroom.''';

const plasticityTip = ''' THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN

KEY #5

Science shows that your brain is always storing new information and creating
new neuropaths. Our message today is that learning is not reserved just for
children, because it is possible for everyone to learn new skills no matter what
their age.''';

const memoryTip = ''' SHORT AND LONG TERM MEMORY

KEY #6

When a student learns new information, it is stored in the cortex. Then it is
redistributed either to the short term memory or long term memory of our
brain. Repetition in different ways will ensure that the new information is stored
in the long term memory, which reinforces permanent language learning.''';

const exploration = ''' EXPLORATION ALWAYS LEARNING

KEY #7

Get to know the culture and language! They go together and make your learning
experience more enjoyable. When you are curious, when you travel, when you
hear new music, or try new foods, and when you explore new places you are
expanding the neuro-connections in your brain.''';
