Question 1:
Inside of the Eclipse IDE, the file->revert option changes the file to the state in which in was last saved. For example, after messing with the indentation and then
saving the file, correcting the indentation and reverting will result in the aforementioned saved file. 

Question 2:
For each friend in the array, the loop steps through various checks to ensure the provided data can be used, as well as calls various functions to print the contents. 
When stepping through the loop, the debugger will take you into a number of other files as it goes into each function as it is called by the other.

Question 3:
After commenting out the toString function, the output becomes impossible for a human to interpret. Instead it returns gibberish data, shown below:
 
Friend: Name & Memory Address??
Who's Coming to the Party?
Friend@1e81f4dc
Friend@4d591d15
Friend@65ae6ba4
