2. The primary challenge I had was how to best transition between the game states. For example, when dealing with large amounts of words, and frequent letters such as 'a' the program takes a little while to respond. Another challenge was figuring out how to best sort / select the words. Although I am certain there are better ways to accomplish both of those tasks, I implemented something that worked for the most part. 
3. I enjoyed the challenge of the assignment, but disliked the debugging the program towards the end as it began to progress the assignment in the wrong direction.   
4. I spent an actual 12+ hours working on the assignment over the course of the weekend. However, I believe that had I used my resources, read: office hours, I could have probably finished the assignment in a shorter amount of time and seen much more success. 
5. I did not add any novel features for extra credit.
 	- I suppose a novel feature of the program is that there are some edge cases, such as the final input of sample output (m) that result in the program throwing an exception for an out of range vector. I tried wrapping several of the functions involving moving / partitioning the words in conditionals related to the size/empty status of the map to no avail. 
	In that sense, the game is truly unbeatable!
