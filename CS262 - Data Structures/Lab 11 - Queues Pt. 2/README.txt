I did not work with a partner on this lab.

I actually do have something I want you to know about this lab. If you uncomment line 37 for whatever reason it will fix the bug in Part 1, going from 23/24 -> 24/24. However, it brings Part 2 from 15/15 -> 12/15. I could not troubleshoot this problem any further and even a TA was unable to find the problem. I also used cout statements to check the front and by all of my testing I believe the test should have passed. 

Also, it was very unclear if I needed to make a separate template class, but I only included the 1 file as I wrote the functions inline as had been done in the provided code.
