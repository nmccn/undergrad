1. Nicholas McClellan, I did not receive help on this assignment.
2. The challenges I encountered were how to best parse the strings into individual words, and although my workaround certainly isn't optimal it served its purpose functionally. 
3. I liked the assignment because it gave a lot of insight into how to navigate through a map, especially the advance function with the iterator.
4. It took approximately 6 hours to complete, I had little time during the week to complete the assignment.
