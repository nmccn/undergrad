/* ******************************************************************
 ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose

   This code should be used for PA2, unidirectional or bidirectional
   data transfer protocols (from A to B. Bidirectional transfer of data
   is for extra credit and is not required).  Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
     are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
     or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
     (although some can be lost).
**********************************************************************/

#define BIDIRECTIONAL 0    /* change to 1 if you're doing extra credit */
                           /* and write a routine called B_output */

/* a "msg" is the data unit passed from layer 5 (teachers code) to layer  */
/* 4 (students' code).  It contains the data (characters) to be delivered */
/* to layer 5 via the students transport level protocol entities.         */
struct msg {
  char data[20];
  };

/* a packet is the data unit passed from layer 4 (students code) to layer */
/* 3 (teachers code).  Note the pre-defined packet structure, which all   */
/* students must follow. */
struct pkt {
   int seqnum;
   int acknum;
   int checksum;
   char payload[20];
    };


/*****************************************************************
***************** NETWORK EMULATION CODE STARTS BELOW ***********
The code below emulates the layer 3 and below network environment:
  - emulates the tranmission and delivery (possibly with bit-level corruption
    and packet loss) of packets across the layer 3/4 interface
  - handles the starting/stopping of a timer, and generates timer
    interrupts (resulting in calling students timer handler).
  - generates message to be sent (passed from later 5 to 4)

THERE IS NOT REASON THAT ANY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO READ OR UNDERSTAND
THE CODE BELOW.  YOU SHOLD NOT TOUCH, OR REFERENCE (in your code) ANY
OF THE DATA STRUCTURES BELOW.  If you're interested in how I designed
the emulator, you're welcome to look at the code - but again, you should not have
to, and you defeinitely should not have to modify
