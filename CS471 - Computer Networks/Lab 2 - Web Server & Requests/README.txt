Anything to do with receiving an image doesn't work, and quite frankly I have no idea why.
All others aspects of the project should be met, ie. it can take several requests and correct usage of 404, 400, 200.


NOTE: I even print the responses for the images and they have the correct size and the headers look to be valid, but 
every time in Chrome it says ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE. Surely the writing back of the file is just bad, but I have no idea why and the more I mess with it the more spaghetti-like it become...
