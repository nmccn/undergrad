1. Nicholas McClellan, I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
2. Most of the challenges surrounded how to properly setup subqueries, and quite frankly I overcame
them by using kind of robust code that I was able to step through logically.
3. As always, I enjoyed the interactivity and being able to test different queries on the database. I disliked not having any kind of immediate grading. 
4. I didn't spend too long on this assignment, maybe 2.5 hours?
