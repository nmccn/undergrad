1. Nicholas McClellan, I didn't collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
2. The biggest challenge was figuring out that I didn't need to use the project3 schema as my search_path. Whoops! I read a piazza post and did some tinkering to overcome this challenge.
3. As usual, the assignment and working with the databases is fun, but I wish I could compare my scripts output with something else before submission. 
4. I spent maybe 1.5-2hrs on this assignment.
