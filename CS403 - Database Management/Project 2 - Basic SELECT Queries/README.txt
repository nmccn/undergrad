1. Nicholas McClellan - this was completed entirely on my own.
2. The most challenging part for me was troubleshooting why the first query brings up text that I have to :q out of like in VIM? I am not entirely sure I would say it has been surmounted, but I think it is just how the software works so I supposed I learned a little about that? (Maybe the text not being limited in space causes this, theoretically it could have scrollable amounts of text?)
3. I liked the idea of answering questions with a single query, but I wish we could have tested our script before submission. While the questions are not ambiguous, it would be nice to know if our format, etc, was correct prior to submission. 
4. Around 1.5 hours to complete this assignment. 
5. I can't think of any off the top of my head.
