1. Nicholas McClellan, nobody helped me with this assignment. 
2. To be honest, I had quite a lot going on so the hardest part was finding a time to do this assignment. Admittedly, I pushed it off for longer than I should have. In general I solved this by watching back the lecture videos and looking through my notes. 
3. I disliked the amount of windows I was bouncing between, I could have used another monitor! I enjoyed having to attempt to build the database from 'scratch'.
4. I spent a couple hours on the actual assignment and another 1-1.5 hours rewatching some of the older lecture videos.
