# CSCI-400 Homework #4

## Setting up the Repository
- **READ THIS FIRST!!**
- **DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO!!!**
- This README and accompanying files are contained in
  the read-only *assignment* repository --
  you will be able to pull from here, but not push.
- To get started on the assignment, first go to your
  *personal/team* repository for this assignment, and
  carefully follow the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file there.
- The basic idea is: you will first clone your personal/team
  repository (**not** this assignment repo), and then add a (read only) remote to pull
  the skeleton code from this assignment repository.

## Basic Instructions

- Complete each of the following Tasks.
- Submit your answers in one of the following
  formats: Markdown (`answers.md`),
  text (`answers.txt`), or LaTeX+PDF
  (`answers.tex` and `answers.pdf`).
- Note that if you choose to use LaTeX, you
  **must** submit both the TeX source `answers.tex`
  and the generated PDF `answers.pdf`.
- If you submit your solution as `answer.md`,
  one option is to use the [CodeCogs equation editor](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)
  to make nicely-formatted images such as the one below
  for any needed mathematical notation.

|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| Task 1: Example list(s)                     | 10     |
| Task 2: Induction proof                     | 30     |
| Task 3: Strong induction proof              | 30     |
| Task 4: Structural induction proof          | 30     |

Recall our inductive definition for the set Lists, representing lists of natural numbers:

<img alt="\frac{.}{[] \in Lists} \quad\quad \frac{x \in Lists\quad n \in Nats}{(n::x) \in Lists}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdpi%7B300%7D%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Cfrac%7B.%7D%7B%5B%5D%20%5Cin%20Lists%7D%20%5Cquad%5Cquad%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%20%5Cin%20Lists%5Cquad%20n%20%5Cin%20Nats%7D%7B%28n%3A%3Ax%29%20%5Cin%20Lists%7D" width="380" />

Let the property `P(x)` be
`max(x) <= sum(x)`.
We will let `max([]) = -∞` and `sum([]) = 0` for the empty list.

## Task 1

When seeing a mathematical property for the first time, it's
often useful to build intuition for *why* the property holds,
by looking at a few examples. This will help guide your
construction of the proofs.

For this task, write down at least two lists `x`, and show
that `P(x)` is true for each.

## Task 2

Second, use *mathematical (``weak'') induction* to prove that
`P(x)` is true for all lists `x`. Hint look at the *length* of
the lists.

## Task 3

Third, use *strong induction* to prove that
`P(x)` is true for all lists `x`.


## Task 4

Finally, use (weak) *structural induction* to prove that
`P(x)` is true for all lists `x`.
