We actually highly recommend you do so to gain a better understanding of what is happening. However, during grading, **these changes are ignored**. \n","2. You must ensure that all your code for the particular task is available in the cells that say \"# YOUR CODE HERE\"\n","3. Every cell that says \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is followed by a \"raise NotImplementedError\". You need to remove that line. During grading, if an error occurs then you will not receive points for your work in that section.\n","4. If your code passes the \"assert\" statements, then no output will result. If your code fails the \"assert\" statements, you will get an \"AssertionError\". Getting an assertion error means you will not receive points for that particular task.\n","5. If you edit the \"assert\" statements to make your code pass, they will still fail when they are graded since the \"assert\" statements will revert to the original. Make sure you don't edit the assert statements.\n","6. We may sometimes have \"hidden\" tests for grading. This means that passing the visible \"assert\" statements is not sufficient. The \"assert\" statements are there as a guide but you need to make sure you understand what you're required to do and ensure that you are doing it correctly. Passing the visible tests is necessary but not sufficient to get the grade for that cell.\n","7. When you are asked to define a function, make sure you **don't** use any variables outside of the parameters passed to the function. You can think of the parameters being passed to the function as a hint. Make sure you're using all of those variables.\n","8. Finally, **make sure you run \"Kernel > Restart and Run All\"** and pass all the asserts before submitting. If you don't restart the kernel, there may be some code that you ran and deleted that is still being used and that was why your asserts were passing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"f5bc91cffca4c7fcddc138415994de5d","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-02f2e430dc0f2177","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"id":"YYKLyFyKXPCM"},"source":["# Deep Learning - Autoencoders\n","\n","In this exercise we'll use an AutoEncoder to learn a dimenionally reduced representation of data and investigate its performance compared to using the original data.

Building a Keras Model with the functional API\n","\n","In this exercise, instead of using the `Sequential` model, we will use the base `Model` in `tf.keras`.

Recall that an encoder is composed of an \"encoder\" portion and a \"decoder\" portion. Your encoder will have two layers, transforming the number of features down to 10 in the first layer, and down to 5 (or less) in the second layer. The output of that second layer will serve as the encoded (or \"embedded\") representation, which will later be used as features for an SVM model.
