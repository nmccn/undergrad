For all activities, you are allowed to collaborate with a partner. \n","1.

Cells in which \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is found are the cells where your graded code should be written.\n","2. In order to test out or debug your code you may also create notebook cells or edit existing notebook cells other than \"# YOUR CODE HERE\". We actually highly recommend you do so to gain a better understanding of what is happening. However, during grading, **these changes are ignored**. \n","2. You must ensure that all your code for the particular task is available in the cells that say \"# YOUR CODE HERE\"\n","3. Every cell that says \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is followed by a \"raise NotImplementedError\". You need to remove that line. During grading, if an error occurs then you will not receive points for your work in that section.\n","4. If your code passes the \"assert\" statements, then no output will result. If your code fails the \"assert\" statements, you will get an \"AssertionError\". Getting an assertion error means you will not receive points for that particular task.\n","5. If you edit the \"assert\" statements to make your code pass, they will still fail when they are graded since the \"assert\" statements will revert to the original. Make sure you don't edit the assert statements.\n","6. We may sometimes have \"hidden\" tests for grading. This means that passing the visible \"assert\" statements is not sufficient. The \"assert\" statements are there as a guide but you need to make sure you understand what you're required to do and ensure that you are doing it correctly. Passing the visible tests is necessary but not sufficient to get the grade for that cell.\n","7. When you are asked to define a function, make sure you **don't** use any variables outside of the parameters passed to the function. You can think of the parameters being passed to the function as a hint. Make sure you're using all of those variables.\n","8. Finally, **make sure you run \"Kernel > Restart and Run All\"** and pass all the asserts before submitting. If you don't restart the kernel, there may be some code that you ran and deleted that is still being used and that was why your asserts were passing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"T_2JoQv4f-GN","nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"7549448ad2c14f6dd4289a8ed77b0c6c","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-9aa804aaaa8f9bca","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false}},"source":["# Feature Learning\n","\n","In this exercise we will run feature learning methods on a dataset to identify the key features to use for predicting a target within it."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Edm3DJnuf-GP","nbgrader":{"grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-675ea75b33420748","locked":false,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633411170628,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":548,"user":{"displayName":"Nicholas McClellan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"06956386808011262879"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import sklearn as sk\n","\n","plt.style.use(\"ggplot\")"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9ABNy9yqf-GX","nbgrader":{"grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-dcc937bc7b3f119b","locked":false,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633411170951,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":326,"user":{"displayName":"Nicholas McClellan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"06956386808011262879"}}},"source":["from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, mutual_info_regression, RFE\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LassoCV\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"CrtnuM-7f-Gf","nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"efaa5584418a51fb0bb196ecd64a09dc","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-700c5cdb1419069b","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false}},"source":["The data we'll be working with is the [California housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-KDRnvGXf-Gf","nbgrader":{"grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-5ec1b36cba18af4d","locked":false,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633411172613,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1669,"user":{"displayName":"Nicholas McClellan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"06956386808011262879"}},"outputId":"7132c15b-cffd-4629-d0b5-544b998fb68c"},"source":["house_data = fetch_california_housing()"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Downloading Cal. housing from https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5976036 to /root/scikit_learn_data\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DQDhiDQsf-Gk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633411172621,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":28,"user":{"displayName":"Nicholas McClellan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"06956386808011262879"}},"outputId":"d029ff5d-2e07-4b1f-dc0b-e216d633fc5d"},"source":["print(house_data[\"DESCR\"])"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[".. _california_housing_dataset:\n","\n","California Housing dataset\n","--------------------------\n","\n","**Data Set Characteristics:**\n","\n","    :Number of Instances: 20640\n","\n","    :Number of Attributes: 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target\n","\n","    :Attribute Information:\n","        - MedInc        median income in block\n","        - HouseAge      median house age in block\n","        - AveRooms      average number of rooms\n","        - AveBedrms     average number of bedrooms\n","        - Population    block population\n","        - AveOccup      average house occupancy\n","        - Latitude      house block latitude\n","        - Longitude     house block longitude\n","\n","    :Missing Attribute Values: None\n","\n","This dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository.\n","http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/\n","\n","The target variable is the median house value for California districts.\n","\n","This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census\n","block group.
